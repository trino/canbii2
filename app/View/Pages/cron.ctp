                    "text" => "As a former user who stopped due to anxiety, I was nervous to try cannabis again but this strain worked perfectly. I refer to my brain as “squirrel in a pinball machine”- I generally find it difficult to focus for long periods of time, switch between tasks frequently and experience anxiety and rapidly changing/worrying thoughts. I had hoped to find a strain that would slow me down without putting me to sleep and this worked very well. \n\nMy first three experiences were with the pre-rolls and I smoked roughly half of the 0.5 gram joint each night at 8 pm for three nights in a row. I felt slightly stoned but was able to carry on a conversation, watch a documentary without switching it/browsing my phone the whole time, and also wash a load of dishes and put them away. None of these things would happen if I was sober. I also experienced a relaxation in my muscles and an elevated sensation to touch so I spent about a half hour in the shower using every bath product I own...\n\nThe fourth time I consumed was via Pax 2 vaporizer and was my first time ever using a vape. With the temperature at the halfway mark I didn’t experience much of a high at all and found that it took away from the experience as a whole (didn’t feel as relaxed). I’m going to turn up the temperature and see if combusting more THC leads me back to the better feeling of the first three sessions.\n\nFor me, after about two hours I’m relaxed with no aches/pains and slipping into bed leads to a deep and unbroken sleep. Although I smoke this in the evening some people may find it too stimulating. I could see this being a great morning strain to help uplift and focus you to start the day off nicely! \n\nI’ve given 5 stars as I would repurchase and the experience for me was great and exactly what I had hoped for. That being said, ~$27 for 1.5 grams is ridiculous and OCS has never had bulk dried flower whenever I’ve searched, only pre-rolls. This is a major disappointment!\n\nI would recommend this product to those new to smoking or who tend to experience anxiety while smoking.",

I found this to be good when you need to drift off, yet not super potent. Flavour is earthy,  and sour; reminding me a bit like Kusawa (Sour Diesel). I have heard this also being called The Blue Dream Experiment and I have seen reports on potential berry like flavours, yet have no experienced anything closely resembling that profile. At its price point it is worth a shot, and I have also notice it being sold slightly higher a price, but it also boasts over 19% thc when mine was 17%. Anyone wanting something on a tighter budget this month may want to pick some up, even if just to try it.  I thought it may be worth noting that it does dry up and sift to a nice amount of kief if anyone was interested in knowing. Anyways, hope this review helped you out. Cheers!",

It has a very strong, pungent smell - not that it smells bad, it's just very noticable and not subtle as soon as you open the bottle. This was prescribed to me with the comment \"this one should knock you out.\" It is to help insomnia and get into a full REM sleep cycle (I do not normally). Although I like the feeling of the effects, I was somewhat disappointed that it *didn't* knock me out. I think the first couple of times I tried it it made me more anxious, or at least my mind was very active and I wasn't able to fall asleep. I have since tried it during the daytime as well and find that it does give you that out of it feeling but not necessarily putting you to sleep.",

The product was worth the wait but not worth the price tag of 12.50/gram. \nIt has a wonderful taste in the vape or rolled up and smoked. Id love to buy this bud again if the price drops to 10$ a gram or cheaper, its ashame some of the highest quality buds are hidden behind prices that are far too much for an average customer to afford.\nThis product was excellent at helping my pain and digestive issues. Helped with my stress and wasnt too strong , left me with energy to do chores around the house. \nBuds were dry and fluffy and busted up very nice and fine in a grinder, great for smoking and vaping.",

On the other hand I hate that my medicine has such an off the wall street name. It’s really my only complaint about this one. If they could rebrand this one under a less, lets say, high school friendly name, I would feel a lot better about using this one.\nThat being said I absolutely love the sedating effects of this one. The smoke is thick and heavy and sends you off to dream land in no time at all. If you use a kiff box then I like to start with some crystals through a water bong, and that is usually enough so make this insomniac pass out in no time at all. If I wake throughout the night I find having a small prepacked single hitter is more than enough to send me back to sleep.\nI’m not a huge fan of vaping this one, but it does give great flavours and a mildly sedating effect. If you’re going to vape I would say you can use this earlier in the day. If you are going to smoke like me, then this is a bed time strain for sure!",

The alien dawg is stronger in THC content at 20%, but is pretty calming.  I screwed up my order when I first placed it and Aphria did an absolutely amazing job fixing my mistake. I actually got this one at a cheaper price then the $12.50 per gram they usually charge. \nSo far I'm quite pleased with Aphria as my LCP.  My only thoughts on what they could improve on is the price of the oils and more expensive strains.  They should really just cap the strains at say $9 a gram to stay competitive with Aurora & Canna Farms.  Reading other patient reviews here on Lift other patients feel the same way.",

My doctor recommended a high THC strain of cannabis to help alleviate my pain, and Alien Dawg had the highest of all the CannWay/Aphria products. This was my first experience with medicinal marijuana, and I didn't know what to expect as far as packaging and quality, and I was pleasantly surprised at the lack of odour from the package. The cannister itself does seem to create a lot of static, and the crystals/hairs were clinging to the sides (as seen in the photos attached), but the lid was sealed/air tight and the buds were in great condition when they arrived. The buds are light and plump, with beautiful little green pods full of resin sacs and with a visible layer of sparkley crystals. The smell is pretty potent and earthy, and reminds me of camping with friends - but you cannot smell it when the cannister is closed. I ingested a small personal-sized bowl and the onset was almost immediate, I felt relief from stress and the sense of euphoria increased as I relaxed. My pain was decreased within 30 minutes, and I'm only now starting to feel the heaviness returning in my lower back (around 4 hours later, with medium tolerence). The smell when combusted was sweet and musky, and tasted earthy and delicious. I was able to sit up (sitting is the most painful position for my condition) and organize my day in a check-list so I can approach it; If i had taken my percocet I would have been unable to focus, let alone create a list allowing me to tackle my day. I guess I'm trying to say I really liked this cannabis, it increased my want to communicate (clearly), it increased my ability to focus, it decreased my pain, and it decreased my stress and anxiety. It did not make me tired or give me couch lock, however my eyeballs feel crispy and dried out.",

As a not-frequent user I tread carefully, but found that  need quite a bit of Alien Dawg to get the desired effect. I don't love the taste a ton, I find the smoke is rough  going down (and up) and even vaping was not very smooth. But, after a more substantial vape sesh right before bed, I felt my muscles  get warm and melty, and I felt calm and happy. Within about 20 minutes I slipped into sleep easily and was content. Normally I am tossing and turning and cannot get comfortable. this made me feel at home in my own skin.  In the morning, it felt as though I had slept much deeper than I normally would.  If i did wake up in the night, I don't recall. Overall very pleased with this strain.\n\nAphria has also been great - quick to register, quick to ship, nice to chat to on the phone. I wish they had some more variety and it seems their stock changes frequently which is good and bad. I do like that they have monthly promotions!",

This strain was very choky and I didn't obtain the pain relief as expected. I also found that the buzz felt was very short lived and one with little effect . I find this strain ok for day use as it wears off with little burnout effects. In saying that I wouldn't recommend one to try and use this for sleep.

Not recommended for anyone novice or below in experience and tolerance.\n\nI think this one is named as such because it will make you feel like an Alien, Dawg! I just had a very small toke through a water pipe, and it’s an almost instant head high. Very heavy, very cerebral. It makes you want to just close your eyes and drift away. Put on some music, enjoy some quiet meditation, or just go to sleep. For the insomniac’s out there this one will be an instant hit! I know I will be saving my next hit of this for when I’m ready to go to bed or if I need to take a nap.\n\nI wouldn’t recommend this one for regular rotation. It provides a certain amount of “couch lock” so if you have no where to go and nothing to do go a head and fire this one up. If you need to be able to think or focus (which I’m having a very hard time doing while writing this, but I like to try it when I review) I would stay away from this one.

Aphria’s selection is OK, a little sparse in the 20% plus thc category but acceptable.\n\nI use the strain for migraine and chronic back pain do to the years of heavy labourer that I have done and still do. It quickly reduces pain and the perception of pain.  In moderate to heavy doses it behaves like a traditional Indica.  What’s interesting is that in low doses it leaves me very energized and euphoric, very creative and active. I find myself cleaning, actively thinking and pursuing tasks or ideas, in short it behaves suspiciously like a sativa.  My caution here is that everyone will have their own experience based on their genetics, level of sleep, activity and countless other variables that make your experience unique to you.",

This strain is the best balance I could find between the relief of my symptoms and the feeling of being ''high'' which I hate. That's why i'm trying THC with CBD strains. It's an Indica so I use it during evening and it has a good calming effect. My pain is not all gone but I still prefer low pain to the feeling of being stoned. I can still watch TV, take a shower, prepare and eat dinner with low pain, no anxiety and a good general feeling. I'm really happy with it because with other strains I can be a couch potato or too nervous because i'm feeling too high and weird. It also helps with my lack of appetite which is good. It was not so good for my insomnia but I may have to find the right dosage for this purpose.

                    "text" => "Argyle is a mild indica that I find induces a calm, relaxed state. I find the CBD content in this strain helpful in managing minor pain, like joint pain or stiffness. However, due to the relatively low amount of CBD present, I find I need to use more of this strain to achieve the same results I would from a strain with a higher CBD content. Furthermore, the THC: CBD ratio is approximately 1:1, so this strain has a slightly more psychoactive effect than CBD strains with a lower ratio of THC. The psychoactive/cerebral effects are mild, though. And although I would not describe my cognitive state after using Argyle as particularly focused, I do not feel particularly absent-minded, either.  So overall, induces a pleasant, relaxed state of mind, and does an adequate job managing pain. \nMy main complaints with this strain comes down to the taste and the smell. People around me have commented on the stinkiness of this strain, but not in the complimentary way. It smells kind of like garlic or chives, or something to that effect, but it's also a little earthy, and there is a touch of something floral or fruity in there, as well. And it tastes pretty much like it smells. If it wasn't for the floral or fruity notes in the mix, I would say it tastes a lot like hash, but the added complexity of the sweetness really ruins it for me. I feel like this plant is trying to do too much, or it's having an identity crisis. In summation, onions and garlic don't mix with flowers or berries. For these reasons, while I can't say Argyle outright tastes unpleasnt, I can't describe it as pleasant, either.  \nAll in all, the positive effects outweigh my issues with the taste and smell. I give this a solid 60%.",

Argyle, being a mix of both helps with everything but I don't find it very strong.  Its very mellow and I think would be the perfect strain for beginners (I found it after trying many other strains over the last couple months).  Also for people needing something very mild acting.  Its a good one for me to take the edge of my chronic illness without feeling high/stoned at all and the price is unbeatable.

I find myself able to think clearer and instead of reacting with a snap decision, I am able to think it out and approach it with a much clearer mind.",

The Argyle (developed at Tweed) has a 1:1 ratio of THC to CBD. The common name of the Argyle strain was Nordle, which was Howard Marks (Mr. Nice) code word for “hashish”, during his cannabis smuggling days in the 1970s.;\n\nAppearance: The Argyle is a genuinely unique looking strain; it has a rich emerald green colour with what appears to be mint cream veins that run up the back of the leaves.  The buds are also home to bursts of super long orange hairs that are scattered throughout the buds.;\n\nSmell The Argyle upon first whiff has a very earthy smell, with a subtle grassy sweetness to it and hints of what could be onion or garlic. But as soon as one grinds up their buds… BOOM, an extremely pleasant aroma erupts that is distinctly fruity sweetness with the earthiness being extremely subtle (similar to banana kush aroma, with hints of pineapple).;\n\nEffects: The Argyle offers very little in the way of psychoactive effects and instead feels calming and relaxing. Not relaxing in a couch-locking way but rather in an anti-anxious kind of way, I felt alert, focused and motivated in an extremely lovely manor; in this way it should allow the user to get on with their daily activities.;\n\nConsumption: I have consumed this strain through a number of methods - a water pipe, joint and a home-vapourizer unit; all of which worked; however this strain leaves the user with a clearer mind if consumed through a vaporizer.",

Pain relief is off the charts (probably a 75% reduction), mood is definitely elevated but not so exuberant that I act differently than normal, thinking is still very clear and I am 100% functional even immediately after vaping my standard dose (3/4 to a full bowl in the Arizer air).  The duration of effects is also fantastic for Argyle - 2 hours+ of full effects, with a gentle taper down.  After the 2 hour mark or so, the pain relief aspect wanes, but a sense of peace and relaxation lingers for a while, making pain less irritating.\n\nThe ONLY downside that I have noticed is that somewhere around the 3 hour mark I experience a major dip in energy.  If I'm at home, this means naptime unless I vape again.  It's a very minor complaint, and I will continue to make this strain a staple in my medicine chest for the foreseeable future.\n\nSmell and flavour are also great.  I find it to be a sweet and earthy, with a heavy vegetable heart.  It might be a pine-like note that I'm picking up, but not something that screams \"I'm Pine!\".  Vapor production is good, but not amazing.\n\nAll in all, this is a very good strain for daytime treatment of anxiety, depression, and chronic pain.  Highly recommended.\n\nP.S. I don't usually comment on shipping in strain reviews, because the two are unrelated in my view.  That said, Tweed really knocked it out of the park this time - the package arrived at my door in less than 24hours.  Amazing product, amazing service.",

Thank you!!!!\n\nOnto my review of Tweeds highest CBD strain (available currently) Argyle aka Nordle - an indica strain with 5.51% THC, 7.74% CBD. 5gr purchased.\n\nI chose this strain as my first strain to use regularly because of its level of CBD. I have a very low tolerance threshold for the psychoactive aspects of THC. The CBD is higher than THC so I thought this would be a great start and wouldn't affect my anxiety (like recreational mj did)\n\nI must say that I love Tweeds packaging, the inside of the box has black and white shaded marijuana leaves which look quite beautiful. I've included a picture to show how Tweed packages their orders. \n\n- the jars containing the mj have childproof lids that are extremely hard to open. They are the type that you push down and turn. Often I find that the lid ends up cross threading and I have to yank it off as it won't unscrew. This is very very difficult, impossible if you have bad arthritis in your hands or other issues with your grip, hand strength, dexterity, etc. There's gotta be a better alternative,\nIt's for these reasons that I immediately put my medicine in different jars.\n\nI ordered 5gr of Argyle for my first try (my mmj experience is 0).  There was one big nug, and several smaller ones, as you can see in my picture. Nice orange hairs, visible trichomes and a lovely smell. I ground up my entire 5gr and put it in a tight vac container. The ground bud is quite light and fluffy.\n\nUsing my DaVinci Ascent vaporizer, I loaded up the bowl with approximately 0.20mg of ground up bud. I start my vaping sessions at 340F, and end at somewhere below 400, it depends on the bud. When the vapor starts to get a little harsh I know that it's time to stop. Argyle produced a nice vapour, no coughing, it flowed smoothly into my lungs with a light exhale that dissipates within 30sec.\n\nI didn't experience a \"high\" with Argyle - which was exactly what I hoped for. No increase in anxiety levels either. As I vaped, my body loosened up, my sharp pains dulled a bit and I was relaxed. Not tired, just not all tense as I normally am due to pain and inflammation.\n\nArgyle was a wonderful \"starter\" for me. Although it didn't provide much pain relief it did allow me to relax, easing the normal tension in my body. I enjoyed this strain, and it is one I will try to always have on hand. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to relax without sedation.",

I found the effects to last for a couple hours and I didn't feel much of a burn out after.  I did get a little sleepy if I didn't move around.  I took this mid afternoon and in the evening which worked out well as I could still function.  I found this to be an alright strain for my first try of medicinal cannabis.  I would use this strain again and intend to keep it around as the price is right.  I did find I got a dry mouth but I assume that is a pretty standard.",

You're not going to find yourself euphoric and coming up with great ideas for your next creative project with Argyle, but you might just feel more capable of dealing with life in general because anxiety sits in the backseat for a while. What it reminds me of is the amount of relief you get from some anxiety meds, and I would much prefer to use cannabis instead.

                    "text" => "BUYING EXPERIENCE:\nAnother order from Tweed and honestly, no more can I say about the exceptional process that hasn't already been said. I logged on to their site and had my order placed in about 5 minutes (I already knew what I wanted). The order was fulfilled within a couple hours and by the next morning it was in my city waiting to be delivered. That afternoon I had my all white, scent-free package in my hands.\n\nREASON FOR BUYING:\nQuite frankly this wasn't a strain I was excited to try, I thought the low THC would dissatisfying me as I enjoy the psychoactive \"trip\" from higher THC strains. I did, however, need a strain I could use for early in the day that wouldn't sacrifice my focus and energy. The mid level CBD was also appealing because I knew it would add a sense of relief from anxiety without causing a massive crash at the end. \n\nLOOK,SMELL&TASTE:\nOnce I cracked the seal and fully opened the jar I, disappointingly wasn't greeted with the overpowering aroma I've come to expect. Instead, it was a very mild scent with a hint of mint or menthol.\nAt first look, the buds themselves were not very aesthetically pleasing. When I looked closer, they were loaded with long, orange pistils and were light and fluffy, cloud shaped buds. I was dismayed when I grabbed the biggest bud that I estimated to weigh at least 1 gram and threw it on the scale to see it only weighed .06 grams. On the bright side, when ground up, this strain was excellent to roll with as it moulded quite easily in my hands because of its stickiness.\n\nGENERAL AFFECTS:\nBeing a seasoned cannabis user, I was expecting a very mild buzz from Argyle (THC5.38%/CBD6.28%) and I wasn't disappointed, however, I didn't anticipate the exaggerated sense of calm you receive. This \"eye of the tornado\" type of calm is more than enough to compensate for the lack of any psychoactive affect.\nI only needed .04g in the bong spread into 2 bowls to feel it's relieving affects, which set in no longer than five minutes after. The initial high lasted for roughly 20-30 minutes and by 90 minutes I felt stone sober with little to no burn out.\n\nMEDICAL AFFECTS:\nI found this strain was best smoked in the morning and mid day to counter any anxiety, while still maintaining focus and a clear mind state. After my second use of Argyle for the day however, I strongly felt the need to mix it or step it up to something stronger in THC.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nThe low THC content in Argyle makes it ideal for the start of the day or for any new cannibus user. It also has a perfect level of CBD that is enough to calm minor, persistent anxiety but not enough to put you to sleep. I would purchase this strain again strictly for the price and CBD content.",

                    "text" => "This indica dominant hybrid gives a relatively calm effect while the aroma produced smells like onion/garlic (almost like a sweet/mild kitchen seasoning). Great taste, mild effects for relaxation and works better (for me at least) when combined with another strain. Personally I found Argyle to be helpful more with symptom(s) relief (such as general body aches/pain and nausea) than THC high. The effects last approx. 1-2 hours depending on the individual and is best used early in the morning to afternoon due to the CBD content being higher than the THC.\n\nPersonally I didn't find this particular strain that useful, as it felt more like a slow time release which didn't seem to provide as much relief as I thought. When combined with another strain, Argyle can potentially be helpful as it helps to boost another strain's attributes by combining both THC and CBD levels as one (average). Overall, I believe this is a good strain when looking to feel relaxed with minimal psychoactive effects. I would buy this strain again as I like combining it with other strains, as it seems to complement them.\n\nEither way this strain is quite affordable, at $6 a gram your getting a good deal. I would recommend this as an introduction to cannabis and/or CBD as its nice and low before moving forward.",

This dank bud is a lesser-known version of the strain Nordle and boasts a 1:1 CBD to THC ratio, with the average ranging between 2-7% for both. Users describe the Argyle high as one that has an almost immediate onset of a euphoric and creative state with flowing waves of energy, making it an ideal wake-and-bake strain for all levels of users. This is accompanied by a feeling of relaxation and meditative creative inspiration with significant pain relief in both mind and body. Due to its potent effects and high CBD level, Argyle is said to be an ideal strain for treating patients suffering from conditions such as chronic pain due to injury or illness, muscle spasms, fatigue, and chronic stress. Argyle buds have an aroma of sweet earthy pine and a taste of fruity pine with a hint of sweet garlic chives. This bud has dense fluffy popcorn-shaped dark forest green nugs with beautifully rich amber undertones, a spattering of fiery orange hairs, and a fine layer of sandy white crystal trichomes.",

It's effects are mild, but definitely there, leaving the head relatively clear, and a nice tingly body-buzz. It's got an earthy aroma, and is a very typical herb-y taste and smell for Indica strains. It's relaxing and calming, leaving you ready for a great night's sleep, without the Couchlock effect (which can unnerve some people).\n\nIt's mildness in the head can also be it's downfall. Argyle just doesnt have the heavy payload that seems to work best for me.  I'd recommend this one more for folks doing physical training or for use in a sports medicine scenario. A bit of this in the late evening relaxes both mind and body. A great hit for after Leg Day at the gym, a hard PT session or just getting the back unknotted after a rough day at work.",

When used in combination with the Lot #3 it provides amazing pain relief yet I am still mentally clear AGAIN JUST VERY RELAXED!  I find other strains for daytime use (Boaty McBoat Face, Lot #3) help with pushing the pain to the background where it is still there...but more as an annoyance.  BUT with the Argyle (or Argyle + Lot #3 combo) the pain is gone...or close to gone for a solid 3-4 hours...to be honest I use it in the evening so I am usually asleep before the pain returns.  Wake up feeling great the next day with no \"hang over\" effects or mental cloudiness whatsoever.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",

I don't normally like to medicate early in the day to avoid feeling burnt out, but with Argyle I don't get that so much. The effects are very subtle; with low THC and high CBD the effects are mostly felt in the body with a slight relaxed and floaty headspace. Very good for remaining focussed and I often use this strain to medicate at work. I prefer to vaporize this strain using my Pax but I also smoke it as well. It has a smooth, if not slightly odd flavour that is hard to describe, not unpleasant though. However, this strain gives me a dry mouth like no other, especially if vaped, so make sure to have plenty of fluids or juicy fruits on hand! This is the only high CBD strain I have tried though and I've heard that is common. It also makes my eyes feel extra dried out.\n\nWhen I wake up with moderate-strong pain, Argyle is my go-to strain so I can continue to function throughout the day. Then I switch to something stronger in the early afternoon.",

I placed my first order to tweed for Argyle on Thursday april 16 at 9.00am, I live in Calgary,Alberta, my medicine arrived at my door on Friday april 18 at 11:30 am, wow talk about fast delivery.\n\nAt first i was hesitant to Vape Argyle due to me having severe anxiety, and underlying OCD, basically my thought patterns repeat them selfs and i worry a lot, I opened the bottle and smelled a deep almost chinese tea like scent. I ordered 5 grams, the buds were very dense as others have stated and to me they looked very nice, I MUST STATE I AM NEW TO MARIJUANA USE, I've probably smoke 15 times my whole life which for the most part always put me into severe panic and anxiety attacks. Once i built up the courage i took a bud that weighed .2 of a gram and grinder it up and loaded my Vape about half of what i had grinded up. I turned the Vape on and set it to Green, which on the Arizer air is the middle setting, waited for it to indicate it was ready, and then took two puffs and waited to see what happened.\n\nInstantly the Argyle tasted, like an Oniony/Garlic flavour about 1 minute past and i could feel it, I found myself smiling, and my buddy could tell i was starting to feel it because i was moving items on my table. It felt like i was a bit head high but not Destroyed like i have been in the past, my body loosned up and then it all hit me, i knew everything i was doing, my eyes felt like they were opened up, and i felt almost Focused/ calm, i had no idea what to expect, but i was clear minded, i felt no anxiety and had littly to no worries. It was exactly what i wanted and had read about. \n\nOnce again this is my views of how i felt, for me Argyle worked, i woke up today feeling perfect, cheerful.\n\nHoped this will help anyone else suffering with Anxiety/OCD, to give them a better idea of what to expect.",

No throat irritation, low odour, small clouds. And they are low cost!\n\nWhy this is a great starter strain:\n\nI’m a born again cannabis citizen thanks to Canada’s medical marijuana program. I am treating for anxiety and depression (recently diagnosed). I have been on 10mg lexapro for two months.  Until yesterday It had been several years since I consumed marijuana.\n\nLast night I broke in my brand new Pax vaporizer with a tiny amount of this primarily indica hybrid. I did not fill the chamber so the draw was not great. What I did get was a peppery kind of draw with zero irritation and very little cloud. I watched Community and ate some candy. My body was relaxed and I felt pretty chill.\n\nI woke up this morning and had a strange feeling. I don’t usually wake up in a good mood. But this morning I felt really at ease. After breakfast I packed the Pax fuller and got a fuller draw. More cloud, more taste, but still no irritation. I went about my day mostly the same. At lunch I went to the gym and after that I had a few more draws from the morning Pax. As the medicine kicked in I felt my body loosen up and the weight on my shoulders go away. I looked up and enjoyed the clouds and smiled.\n\nFor the rest of the day I functioned quite normally. I picked up my kids and their two friends, took them all to the gym, installed a new bookshelf in my office, did some work in said office, and was in a fairly good mood.\n\nOnce everyone was in bed I took a few more draws from the Pax I packed this morning. Got a little glow from that and proceeded to do some work from home.\n\nIn summary, I spent most of the day doing quite normal things with people close to me and nobody seemed to notice anything ‘different’ about me. Internally however, I have felt like I am on winter vacation. Argyle seems to be a strain to use all day. I am looking forward to staring my day with it tomorrow.",

It was spongy, smooth smoking and put you into a perfect kush mellowness with its high THC 19-25% so it was worth the wait. However, this star started to fall about a year ago when THC levels consistently got lower and the bud got drier. Supply problems, as with all quality Tweed products, got worse. But... I always had hope that I would get a good batch again.  Now, with my first medical batch since legalization, I curse myself, in response to an email from Tweed before legalization, for voting for Bakerstreet in the 2018 Cannabis Cup awards. My vote was entirely based on experience from past years. Admittedly I was shocked to see the post-legalization price of this bud increased by 50%. You would think that would be a no-no for a supplier af any medical product. I bit the bullet and hoped that the premium price was going to be supported by the premium product that Bakerstreet had once been. Alas, it’s so dry that it crumbles to powder which induces coughing. My hopes were further dashed by its relatively weak THC clocking in at a questionable 17.3% - a good 5% lower than average historical levels which makes it hard to attain the kush mellowness without having to increase consumption. At $9 plus shipping and sales taxes this product is poor value.",

Usually it doesnt take me much (2-3 puffs) to feel the effects in that regards.\n\nWith this indica dominant strain, i did notice i had to heat it longer to have a better terpine profile as well and inhale alot more to find those soothing effects. \n\nThe dry texture and garlicy-musky bud was pre ground ( thanks dispenseries!)  And was purchaced pre rolled. \n\nRelaxing and focused high was achieved shortly after but with a slight headache to follow as i find i get sometimes with hybrids.\n\nRecommended to first timers for a gentle buzz,  could be used daytime but suggested for relaxing night at home playing music or painting as it is a indica. Sleep solid 6 hours or more.",

                    "text" => "I bought a 1 gram package of Soleil's \"Balance\" from the SQDC, a roughly 1:1 or 1:1.5 THC:CBD ratio. My package stated 5.13% total THC and 8.83 Total CBD.\nThis is my first time trying a strain with such a high concentration of CBD (as far as I know). I was feeling stressed and anxious before using, with some slight emotional unbalance. Second time smoking cannabis in many years and I am a neophyte. \nCannabis looked and smelled the closest thing to what I used to find on the street, out of the three strains purchased from SQDC. Floral, slightly orange and earthy with a mild garlic/onion scent and some mildly fluffy and leafy buds. Although this is a variety of Nordle strain, it didn't appear too resionous. Buds were much less dry than other strains I purchased, but it was also packaged two months later (October as opposed to August).   \nI smoked in 4 short sessions (approx 0.05 g) from a small glass pipe taking 1 small puff each time. It burned quite well and took off with simply touching the flame to the plant meterial briefly and produced a full-bodied smoke that went in nicely. It did feel nice and I enjoyed the smoke. It seemed to burn quite well and \"take off\" due to the resin hidden within the flowers.\nI initially got the cerebral \"high\" and felt like I could hear in 3D/4D and heard an annoying high pitched sound like it was coming from my brain, but was most likely a sensitivity to an almagamation of all the vibrations and noises coming from things like my PC, fridge, monitors, etc.. The body effects took longer than expected to kick in and at around the 30-minute mark I experienced a warmth radiating from my chest/diaphragm region which slowly spread throughout my body.\nOverall, I felt a high but seemingly rounded and sanded around the edges by the CBD. Although the effect seemed more powerful cerebral-wise, it was also milder and more rounded in some aspects. It's hard to describe. There was anxiety until the body effects kicked in which turned into a tired, mildly euphoric body stone, with minimal trippy effects (at least compared to Purple Kush which had trippy effects for at least 2 hours). I also got slight munchies after about 2 hours which never happens for me, so this is an appetite stimulant. I feel like this strain is a good primer for bed as it doesn't incite your brain to run rampant. At times I just felt kind of normal, mildly focused, and just sleepy. At times I felt like my brain was shutting down. \nI passed out watching videos on my smartphone while lying in bed, which is something I rarely ever do, woke up 2 hours later with the phone still playing videos. Slept a solid 8 hours and feeling stress-free and relaxed the next day, with slight pressure in my head. \nNegatives I noticed were (compared to my Purple Kush experience which I wrote on here)- Headache (which might just have compounded the already mild head ache I had prior to smoking)- Diziness, which I never experience on Purple Kush - I felt more effects I didn't generally like than with Purple Kush but it was less \"sharp\" of an experience\n\nI'd try this again if I wanted a mild experience and nice smoke and wanted to get to sleep.  ",

The package I received states 5.37% THC and 9.85% CBD.\n\nIt smells pleasant and has a nice appearance to it. The smell is earthy and not extremely strong. The packaging it came in works well to contain the smell of it and I could not smell the cannabis through the shipping packaging at all.\n\nI rolled a joint and smoked a bit of it. The flavour is okay, not the best tasting but not bad either. Again the taste is relatively earthy. \n\nI smoke during the evening mostly daily in small amounts so my tolerance isn't very high but also isn't nonexistent. This strain took about 10 to 20 minutes to kick in and gave me a mild head high. It made me feel very mellow and relaxed. It gave me a fairly strong relaxed feeling in my body and I noticed that my leg muscles that had been cramping that day felt a lot better. I would say the high lasted for about 1.5 to 2 hours. I smoked a bit more and then went to bed and had a great sleep.\n\nI would recommend this for someone who doesn't want something too strong that is looking to wind down at the end of the day.",

That being said, it's the best cannabis I've purchased from OCS so far.\n\nOpening the jar the first time I was met with a wonderful yet mild aroma. It's not super pungent, but there is no mistaking the smell. Mostly earthy notes with a touch of citrus and musk.\n\nThe bud itself was comprised of medium sized nugs covered in vibrant rusty hairs and plenty of frosty crystals. It had been perfectly cured as there was some springiness to it; it didn't turn to dust in the grinder like some of the other cheaper strains from OCS.\n\nThe smoke was fine, nothing major to report. There was a bit of coughing, but hardly enough to even be worth noting. No real flavour\nworth noting either.\n\nThe high was great. It came on fairly gently and lasted about 3 hours +. There were bouts of giggles and moments of introspection. Despite having smoked this in January I ended up building a gingerbread house kit that was leftover from Christmas. At about the 2 hour mark I finally hit the couch to chill where there was some minor couch lock. After listening to a bit more music (which was definitely enhanced) I decided to call it a night and had a wonderful sleep.\n\nAll in all, despite the higher price tag I think I would like to keep some of this on hand.

I didba couple of french style inhales and I can catch small whiffs of berries stuck in my nostrils.\n\nThe smoke was harsh even though the bud was sticky so that sucked. But the high is a quick set in (I'm writing this as it happens). It's pretty intense so far being 23%THC, and has induced a little anxiety but it's manageable. It's really nice to play videogames or watch TV. It's very heady and the high is similar to strains like MK Ultra and Sour Diesel.\n\nThis is definitely one of my top 10 favourite strains.

Was a little stressed but after getting high I just went with my thoughts and it was all good.\n\nYou'd like it, but there's no outstanding flavor, it's just a sour smell.",

Put this under the knows of a blind sniffer and they'll have no idea that what they're smelling is cannabis or anything other than a bowl of dried blueberries.   Comparable to Shishkaberry from same LP, but I would say even better!\nThe buds come in little nuggets, visually unimpressive but I've never judged cannabis on looks alone and for me, someone who microdoses, I actually prefer smaller nuglets.  \nSo far I only consumed in joint form.  I find joints hide the flavour and everything just tastes burned.  They high onset is just like any other strain, and last about 1.5 before you start to come down which for me is average.  Going forward, I will stick to the vape to take advantage of the woderful flavour this strain offers.\nThe high can be described as heady at onset.  I find all stress and anxiety completely disappeared.  I am also experiencing IBS symptoms lately (perhaps stress-induced, who knows) and they disappeared with this stuff.\nAlthough this is an excellent strain for stress and anxiety, it is also a heavy hitter.  The high is quite strong, and I found it gave a bit of a couchlock effect.  I would seriously not recommend consuming during the day or if you have any intention of getting anything done.  This is purely a sit and chill type strain.  Good for unwinding in the evening or chilling on the beach/park/wherever.  \nI find other strains have comparable medicinal benefits and still manage to keep me clearheaded and functional.  My whole reason for seeking an LP is to get access to strains that keep me functional.  This is not one of those strains.\nGiven the limited medicinal benefits and the fact that this is really only suited for end of day, I have to give this strain a lower score.  I find the price is inflated for it's limited use and would be better priced at $8 or $8.50.  As others have commented, I do not want to pay premium prices just because of flavour.\nIf you suffer from stress and anxiety and don't plan on or have a need to be productive while high on this, then this is definitely a strain for you and I highly recommend it for that demographic.  Personally I have other strains better suited to my needs and will likely not buy this again. \n",

I am shocked by the packaging for only 1 gram of cannabis.... this box is nearly double the size of a pack of cigarettes for example. Once you get the inner plastic shell out you can see the size is excessive. Plus, once you have opened it, there is no way to securely reseal the package if you open it. It is plain wasteful and I am inclined to store in another container. But I really feel like this is a lot of wasted cardboard and plastic. SAVE THE PLANET!\nThe cannabis itself holds a pleasant grapefruit scent- it is very earthy and cirtusy. The buds are average looking with lots of orange hairs. As for my obsessive thinking.... I have been completely engaged in The Office and enjoying watching just for watching. My worries and stress has definitely melted away. I am noticing my HR increasing a bit, so I think 2 full stems from my solo 2 is more than enough to melt my headache away, stop the crazy over-thinking, but is just enough to not induce anxiety.

The whole buds have a nice aroma, and while vaporizing it reminded me of strawberries.  I'm still working on my aroma and flavour descriptors. :)\nAs I'm a bit of a lightweight, I like my cannabis mellow and Campfire fits the bill. I find it's a grest strain for hanging out at home and listening to some calm music at the end of the day, but Campfire's apparent anti-anxiety properties (everyone's different, of course) make me confident consuming this out in a social setting as well without the fear that I'll become too paranoid or introspective to carry on a conversation with good company. I've remained focused and have no problems keeping my attention on at least this task. I would actually love to try this sitting around the campfire on a cool summer evening. \nThis was fairly dry when I received it in my first order from OCS, as is all the pot I've received in the mail so far (even the medical strains I've had tried from Tweed [Souris Skies/Sensi Star] and from MedReleaf/San Rafael '71 [Sedamen/Pink Kush], so I rehydrated this fully before using and would recommend doing so. Vaped at 356 degrees and there was no visible vapour; this temperature also made for a smooth inhale with no harshness, and this low temperature may also contribute to the mellowness of this particular experience.\nAbout an hour on, I'm coming down a bit. A slight headache miiiight be creeping in, my eyes are a bit on the dry side, and I've felt the need to hydrate a few times since time of consumption; so, like when the breeze wafts the smoke of this strain's namesake into your face as you're roasting a marshmallow, you might expect a bit of dryness when using Campfire.  \nOverall, this is an enjoyable strain that I would readily purchase again to keep on-hand for those times when a subtle, coherent lift is what the doctor ordered.  ",

That said, I can see how in excess it could easily be sedating. It has a low THC% and moderate CBD%. The CBD in it knocks out any anxiety plus helps significantly with nerve pain. Neck tension is melted away with this one!  \n\nMuch like a lot of CBD strains, don’t expect too much flavour wise. For a CBD rich strain, it wasn’t a horrible taste - earthy and very slightly garlic like. It is a relatively smooth smoke. \n\nThis is definitely a strain I’d purchase again and was pleasantly surprised by. For a strain so low in THC, I wasn’t expecting very much.

I tend to not smoke during the day becayse previously I had found that I become lazy when I smoke and essentially just want to lay around. However, when I smoke Shark Shock, I am still a functioning person, and could do almost everything I would normally do during the day after smoking it. I can still study, workout, do assignments, have sex etc., and I wont feel any drawback while doing this due to the strain. I would reccommend this to anybody looking for a very controlled high for everyday activities, or even just to clear your head prior to sleeping. By-far the best I have ever smoked, and I hope they restock on the Ontario Cannibas Store soon so I can purchase more! You will not regret trying this strain!",

This strain took my cramps away, and gave me a nice little uplifted high.\nI vaped little less that 0.5 grms @ 15% THC. BOY was it a good trip. My body got a really nice buzz, but then I got the calming almost happy head high! It lasted a few hours. I felt like I could go to bed if I wanted, but I preferred to stay awake and watch some videos.\nMy limbs were heavy, but my cramps were a million miles away.\nThe taste wasn't anything special, and it smelled earthy and spicy. The buds weren't too dry as they came in a jar with a integra boost humidity pack.",

                    "text" => "Recently I went to the Toronto Lift Expo 2018 and become a registered medical patient with Beleave Kannabis Corp. thru Medi-Green clinics. My first order from Beleave was the 50/50 hybrid (I think it is more indica dominant) Cold Creek Kush coming in at 18.3% THC and 0.007% CBD, priced at $9.75-10.00 per gram, I decided to purchase just one quarter (7 grams) which is the smallest size they offer. Made my order over the phone because Beleaves website was having difficulties regarding shipping selection and did not have pictures of the strains as well as no description of the strain (no mention if indica or sativa, no terpene profile and no lab tested report to view). The bigger more advanced Licensed Producers (not going to mention names) offer what is lacking on Beleaves website as standard info on their websites, so I think Beleave should take the time to improve those features as it is crucial info that can help a consumer make a better choice. On a positive note, the client services rep on the phone was courteous, knowlegeable and quickly helped me complete my order securely. Also, I did notice the more you order there is a slight price break similar to what your black market connect may offer. Shipping and taxes on top resulted in my order being just over $90 total. The order arrived on schedule via Purolator (eventually Beleave is to offer more shipping options for example Canada Post). When I opened my 'welcome package' to my surprise there was a Beleave branded grinder (they must've known I needed a new one soon) neatly positioned in the box along with my cannabis and patient card / info booklet, which was great touch. Side note: if Beleave is a environmentally friendly / concious company they should reconsider the size of their 'welcome package' as it comes with a lot of cardboard waste, other than that it was a welcoming experience and I couldn't wait to test the product. \nThe Cold Creek Kush strain is dominanted by the following terpenes (in no particulr order): myrcene + alpha-pinene + caryophyllene + linalool + beta-pinene + d-limonene and terpineol. The strain smells excatly as advertised from the terpene profile (which was found in the info booklet provided in my order) it is, fresh, potent, earthy, hints of coffee, herby/piney/spicey and a bit citrusy. The flower is mostly dense and trimmed well but couldve used a closer hand manicure on some buds. The overall smoke experience is clean, smooth and tasteful with white/grey-ish ash to compliment a great cure. The high from smoking was long lasting, calming, euphoric and uplifting with little burn out after not smoking for a few hours after my initial intake (keep in mind I tend to smoke out of my bong). Out of the 7 grams there was around 0.5 grams of shake/trim/popcorn buds, I may sound picky but thats just connoisseur in me because I think at these prices you should get the full 7 grams guaranteed. Long story short, Cold Creek Kush is a great daytime /evening strain and is grown extremely well by Beleaves Master Growers, I look forward to my next order from Beleave Kannabis Corp. and can't wait for more strains / oils to come to the menu. \nThanks!\n\n",

Delivery was very fast but when I placed my order there was only two sativa options available and two  Indica strains available so I picked one of each with the higher THC content. Both the sativa and indica were so dry they literally turned to powder when ground(medium grinder). Not a very good first experience! The flavor was ok but a little chemicaly. I hope a few days with some Boveda62 packs will revitalize this flower.  Broken Coast products have totally spoiled me.  I will give Canna Farms another chance but that’s it!\n",

It really improves my mood.\nAfter: I tend to get very dry eyes but that is pretty typical for any type of weed I vape. I dont feel drowsy after Ive vaped this strain, it is a nice clean comedown. I dont feel groggy when I wake up if I've vaped this strain before bed.\nThe purchasing process is very streamlined and easy to follow.

The second time I tried it, it was an amazing body high with a nice head/cerebral effect as well.  Me and a buddy of mine got together for a vape session, and we both got hit with some serious munchies!  Luckily we had planned ahead so we had plenty snacks at hand, but beware... you're gonna want to eat everything in sight.   This is becoming my go-to standard strain for a good body/head high and I've ordered more.  \n\nI've only tried this out in my vape pen so far, but I'll probably load up a pipe or bong at some point.  For me, the effects actually kick in half-way through my second sesh (approx. 7 to 10 min).  If you really want to extend your high, vape/smoke and then drink some coffee... I did this for New Year's and I was flying high my entire evening (5+ hours).\n\nI highly recommend giving this strain a try if you've had some experience with other strains and are looking for a great sexual enhancer, munchy inducer and body relaxer!",

The quality of the flower it contained actually seemed to have some moisture still and wasn't dried to a crisp. Which in turn made for a very smooth and tasteful smoke. Compared to others. This pre roll smoked exceptionally well. Burned evenly and did not run. Was very smooth to smoke and easy on the throat and lungs. And had a very pleasant fruity taste.

I was very happy and pleasantly surprised with the quality of this pre roll. Got me pleasantly lifted! Quality of the roll job was spot on for being machine rolled. The quality of the flower it contained actually seemed to have some moisture still and wasn't dried to a crisp. Which in turn made for a very smooth and tasteful smoke. Compared to others. This pre roll smoked exceptionally well. Burned evenly and did not run. Was very smooth to smoke and easy on the throat and lungs. And had a very pleasant fruity taste. Burned longer than most of my own 1 g rolls. So definitely impressed. This pre roll surpassed every one of my expectations. Very happy with it. Definitely buying more Synr.g pre rolls!",

So it was a perfect opportunity to sample it. It was the 1 gram J so we didn't quite need the whole thing between 3 people. It was a nice euphoric and comfortable stone. I cut out mid way through as the high was very effective.  Nice head high component but also relaxed the body.  Although all the pre-rolls I've tried so far are a bit dry and this one was no exception to that unfortunately. But what can you expect? A pre-roll will be dry if it sits no matter what the container. Very fruity flavor with a touch of floral to it. I've heard people describe it as kool-aid and gummy bears too.  All in all I would definitely get it again and this time I'd shoot for the 3.5.",

I have servere, medicated GAD, and some strains really make it so much worse. Fantasy Island didn't do any of that. I felt relaxed, giggly, happy... It was an entire body high. When I was focusing on things, I knew what was happening. When I was trying to recall things I was totally lost.  \n\nMy husband enjoyed it quite a bit. It's probably the highest he's ever been. I felt the most like I'd taken a mood changer or even LSD. It was spectacular. \n\nWe eventually went to be around 1230, and we were definitely still high. I woke up with my toddler at 830 and I felt great. As the day went on, I felt more nausea, but I'm assuming that's from all the Lindt chocolate and popcorn I ate while high.",

This is around 630 - 7pm.\n\nWhen I take it at night I have a burst of energy to complete my nightly chores, get a work out in, or go out;  this burst of energy normally lasts about an hr to 1.5 hrs, then the sleepiness kicks in. In most cases this isn't too bad because I'm just about ready to go to bed anyway.

The only way i can deal with this strain is to only take a pinch of it with indica and CBD.  Otherwise im in for a bad trip.  Not all sativas do this to me, but this one seems particularly potent.\n\nI took only two pinches of it in my pax 3 and filled the rest with bubba kush.  I took a small amount of cbd oil under my tongue immediately after vaping this with only 3 petals.  Within minutes i felt anxious.  I took more cbd, did breathing exercises and drank water and focused on relaxing.  Walking and standing helps, sitting made it much much worse.\n\nFortunately by the time it passed my migraine was gone for several hours.\n\nAgain i vaporized at lunchtime however i took much less vapor into myself.

It's not like indica where you can do bowl after bowl till you pass out. Sativa will energize you and speed up your thoughts, making it great for depression but not great for sleep aid or anxiety.

Not too dry but a boveda helped bring it back to life. \nIn my 30's and not looking to get stoned off my face, but this will get you there if you want it to. On a sunny Saturday I would take small pulls from my firefly 2, and it creeps up slowly over 10-15 minutes. Taste is pretty good. Citrus and pepper. Energetic, clear minded and listening to music/cleaning was fun. Made the sunshine warmer and brighter. Careful though, I got a little too excited and took an extra pull that I maybe shouldn't have, and my mind definitely went into racing territory. Still not into full-blown paranoia or anxiety like I'm prone to, but if I smoked a full bowl of this I'd probably be hiding behind my couch watching for lizard people. If you have a high tolerance I would definitely recommend, though other reviews state it may veer into indica-like couch lock when consumed in higher quantity. Haven't tested this myself yet. For some good energy and focus, just take a little bit as you go and find the right dose for you. If you're depressed or feeling down, have a go at this. Maybe mix with some CBD herb to tone it down a touch. Don't use before bed!",

Let alone that the pain was gone, all of it. The happiness was almost too much. Bonus: no silly antics that come from alcohol, and no vicious hangover! No stomach upset from NSAIDs or codeine. \nStill, a little overpowering for me. I was totally useless for anything but sitting and smiling, which I did like a pro!

For one, the taste is far from the best I have tried (likely a byproduct of the potency), but is still genuinely tolerable. Second, this strain is one that may leave people in their own head. As a patient who uses marijuana to treat anxiety and depression, there were experiences with this strain which worsened an unneeded train of thought. Some slight feelings of paranoia were also experienced throughout my time with the strain, but it was nothing crippling or disabling in context to the high.",

Previous to this I ordered 25g and got free shipping the product took 2 days to get to me. \n \nI go my Batch of Ghost Train Haze during WeedMD's Black Friday sale as well as the Cyber Monday sale. Their sales are awesome I feel appreciated as a customer with WeedMD which makes me want to keep coming back, They are always having sales/deals and give away swag with orders like my welcome package I received was a lockable stashbox... cant really beat WeedMD when it comes to customer service.\n\nWeedMD's Ghost Train Haze Nug size are large to medium and COVERED in beautiful trichromes  and this to me is surprisingly unusual from an LP I am so used to getting tumble trimmed garbage with no crystals (Tweed).\n\nGhost Train Haze smells to me very similar to Lemon Skunk from Tweed... very Piney Cirtrus smell which makes this strain even more appealing to me.\n\nI take cannabis for pain management and WeedMD's Ghost Train Haze was no let down, about 5 minutes after smoking my back and knee pain were almost un-noticeable .\n\nEffects were very nice 5 minutes in you can start feeling your eyes getting a little heavy and a nice relaxed cerebal affect after that the affect starts to build even more I almost felt like a super hero I was so full of energy.

You've got the Hashy subtle citrus flavor from the Ghost OG, the slightly spiced sweet of Nevil's haze and the odd floral mentholated layer of the Trainwreck.   having a 21% batch right before this recent 26% batch the terps appear consistent considering the first batch being pulled a few days early \n\nCan't wait to get a clone and treat her to some nice CMH lighting. \n\nThe lower strength batch came off as a very gentle haze influenced slightly uplifting slightly contemplative kinda zen vibe. This stronger batch adds to this in a more traditional Zippy haze way same effects but very cerebral.  Due to the haze influence there is very little ceiling at this strength, lower tolerance users should be wary very easy to over do it with this kinda of no limit zippy haze.\n\nI like this strain for late morning/ afternoon hybrids that still has some get up and go to them.",

The end of the high is really mellow, not like the start, you are really alert, focus and energetic. You can feel the vibe, you want to go outside even if it’s grey and sad. It’s a perfect strain for a walk or hiking, it will give you the boost that you need. \n\nThe aromas of this strain are pretty strange, when I oppened it at first I was almost in shock by its smell, like how the f**k weed can smell that. I would say it smells cat litter but a pleasant one, not a hard hitter in the nose, but you can definitely smell  ammonia with a sweet citrus and spicy smell of its Haze origin. I was pretty impressed by this strain, but it’s a little pricey when you compare with Wine Gums that is really potent and just 10$ versus 12$ for the GTH.",

To be honest I was a little worried it might not do the lineage justice but was very happy I had nothing to worry about.\n\nPackaging was a nice plastic jar, bonus for no extra box, but personally I'd prefer it in a vacuum sealed bag. Everything ultimately goes into proper glass storage with boveda so the jar goes in the recycle. \n\nThe smell on unsealing was very strong with notes of citrus, lemon, and pine. It has a surprisingly nice nose for flower that doesn't seem cured to it's full potential. Although this could be caused by the time spent on the shelf without a boveda. I'll have to see how it does overnight. \n\nI tested with my standard 0.5 grams rolled into a filtered joint. First joint of the day. Effects were being felt before finishing and had a very high peak. High is clear minded, cerebral, and very energetic. There is a slight anxiety present but overall it reduces my anxiety by providing an energy boost and focus. \n\nThis is also an excellent strain for enjoying music. In fact I'd say it's a must! I find I can feel a deeper euphoria from the music while using this strain and it provides a slight body effect I really enjoy.\n\nOnly real negative was around the cure as the joint was a little harsh. I've had well cured hazes that are so smooth you forget you're smoking.\n\nOverall this stays true to the lineage and I'm very impressed. Price wasn't bad for the quality but I'd still like to see it come down a bit. If you're new to cannabis this is a good one to try but start slow because it's very strong and the type of sativa that can lead to a very uncomfortable experience if you overindulge.",

Right away from the neck up my head started felling vey warm and light feeling.  Great !!.  I then noticed the calm, warm felling moving down my body.  It was long b4 I was melted into the sofa.

I have been trying a bunch of different strains to see what I like and I came across God Bud. I researched it, found out it was Canadian and thought I will give it a try. Compared to the others I have tried, others even from Redecan, this was a very bad experience. Upon opening my container my entire room immediatly smelt skunky. I know that this is a smell that can happen from cannabis but I had not experienced this with any other strain thus far.\n\nIt came packed well, decent nug size and they were complete nugs. I ground up one of the smaller nugs and filled the tip of my dynavap m. Immediatly I was very put off by the taste, it resembled the taste of dust or dirt. Like I was driving down a back road with my windows down. I tried a few more hits and decided this was not for me.\n\nI did get a decent high from it, I zoned out for about an hour and then got really sleepy. Had dry mouth after, but so far every strain has done this, no headaches or noticable effects the next day.\nI belive that this is a great strain for some people just not for me.\n\nThank you,

Despite the flower being extremely dry and a little hard to smoke, the high it delivered was stellar. It was a medium head and body high despite having 18% THC, but the effects were some of the cleanest I've experienced. Usually when I smoke there is a brief period of mild anxiety before I settle into the high, but this was just relaxing from the start. Though my body felt slightly heavy I was enjoying walking around my house slowly (which I'm sure gave me the appearance of an old man). Throughout the high there were bouts of laughter, a happy calm, and an overall sense of euphoria. after the initial 1.5-2 hours I decided to smoke a bit more to keep the high going, which I have surprisingly never done or wanted to do before. Usually I'm good with a 2 hour high, but I wanted this to keep going. The only negative side-effects I noticed were slightly dry eyes and mouth which were easily remedied, both with water. At about the 3 hour mark I finally sat down and just relaxed while listening to some mostly instrumental music for about an hour before crawling into bed for an amazing sleep. I only bought the 1g to start with but I plan on buying more in the near future. If you made it to this point of my review I would just like to remind you that everyone's experience is different and you may not have the same enjoyment I did, but here's hoping.",

I was able to re-hydrate it using the old spinach trick but even still I wouldn't say that it was living up to it's reviews.\n\nI've had GSC before and it usually puts me into a super happy zone pressing the couch lock button but not quite. This was definitely not that. It did wind up alleviating some stomach pain I was having and moved quickly to make me feel uplifted even if I smoked about twice as much as I have in the past to get a mild buzz.\n\nWhile my stomach did feel free of discomfort for the rest of the evening the uplifted effects were fleeting and after about an hour they were gone.\n\nA pretty disappointing experience from one of my favourite strains.

All times smoking this led to fatigue eventually, so would recommend for evening.\nWhile I enjoyed the high, and the price was decent, the quality was low and terepene profile not as advertised...so wouldn't buy again.",

The aroma and flavor profiles of the strain were also not great and has a pretty bad after taste. The oddest part for me was the nausea I got from smoking it. I consider myself an avid smoker, using 2-3 times per day. I have a great tolerance. But I would get the worst nausea, head rushes, and faintness from this strain. The other day I almost passed out off two bowls. So strange to me as I've never experinced this before and it happened every time I smoked this.

Dense, tightly packed little nuggets that have an earthy, peppery aroma and a hard hitting punch to the cerebrum that will have you coming back time and again to this strain.\n\nExcellent for melting away the stresses of the day but best enjoyed in the evening or when making critical decisions is not paramount.  Kinky Kush will have you glue to your couch for hours.  Its got the usual dry eye and dry mouth side effect and it will certainly knock you out better than Mr Sandman could with his magic beam.  \n\nMy wife and I thoroughly embrace this Indica from Liiv.  Without saying to much it gets the fiery passion going in the bedroom if you know what I mean.  Its certainly a nice complement to a Netflix and Chill day.  \n\nTry it, you'll love it.  We do!.",

The taste/smell, as is the case with many budget strains (Liiv's Bali Kush; Good Supply's Jean Guy), is nothing incredible. That being said, as somebody who does not really smoke for flavour, I would definitely purchase Kinky again as even after smoking higher-quality strains from OCS, Kinky Kush provides a good catalyst for a hard nap or full-on sleep without being too heavy and thus making you wish you were awake for your high. Don't get me wrong though, it's equally effective for a self-induced-couchlock gaming session.\n\nI've tried this strain both in pipes/bongs as well as in joints/blunts and either method of consumption was enjoyable.

It's citrus and lemone flavouring is very much something to experience.\n\nIf you are going for cerebral impact, bring the temp in your vape up a notch and I feel that this Sativa dominant hybrid punches above the rated THC content.  \n\nI did try smoking this in a big fat joint while walking my dog, yet the confused state at which I arrived home in definitely testifies to the ability of the lemon Skunk to put you in to a couch lock if required.",

Knowing this was a pretty middle of the road Indica at around 15% THC at the time I used a half pack bowl with my PAX 3. The effects immediately hit me when I came into the warm house from the cold. But it wasn't until I sat down at my computer that I discovered the incredible melting feeling this strain provided. My body and muscles were incredibly comfortable for the rest of the night, quickly finding comfort in my bed, and relaxing while listening to some very calm and relaxing music. I was surprised to find that along with the great body high and euphoria. This strain also provided me with a mild psychoactive experience. When listening to my music I felt as though It was like the artist was there in the room singing to me, and I could focus in on the long synth notes in the song. I also felt more spatially aware under my blankets. The only minor negatives were that I experienced very minor moments of anxiety and paranoia while being in the dark of the room. However, they weren't distracting enough to kill the overall mood. I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone who is looking to experience a nice high, enjoy their favourite music, and get a good nights rest.",

The flower was cured perfectly and was a pleasure to smoke. My only complaint with the order (aside from OCS taking 10 days to get it to me) is that my 3.5 gram order was made up of numerous small buds versus a few larger ones. Not always a bad thing to everyong, and it didn't impact my enjoyment of the flower, just sometimes it's nice to recieve some bigger buds.\nThe high was great. I felt relaxed, happy yet not too tired. This batch was 8.01% THC and 14.52% CBD. I enjoy the milder stuff vs high-THC so this was perfect. A nice dollop of CBD on top and it made for an enjoyable night.",

Buds are just very dense and sticky, even though fairly dry.\n\nTastes great in the vaporizer and average in a joint.   A bit more of a cerebral high comes through when smoking rather than vaporizing but gives a nice light buzz either way. Major payout is due to the CBD though.  Almost immediately dissolves any stress or anxiety as well as significantly reducing body pain and aches.  I find that those effects tend to last well beyond the end of the THC buzz. I really enjoy the uplifting and active feeling it gives you for daytime and evening use. Also enjoy blending with higher THC indicas and sativas to add more cerebral or body effects to complement the CBD depending on my mood. \n\nWorking my way through the rest of the  WeedMD catalogue but this  will definitely be one I come back to often.",

It was wonderful. And I will tell you I got a little high from this...high enough for me as I don't want to be messed up. I had the perma grin going on and felt pretty happy....even though I didn't get any welcome gift sniff sniff. The biggest thing I noticed is the smell as soon as I opened it BAM wow how sweet it is. And as it sits a few feet away I can still smell it in it's closed container saying I'm here for you buddy ;). Only thing is it is a bit pricey especially with shipping costs and it would have been nice to have the option to add a gram of this or that to try but no option to do this.

The smell is so amazing, it’s very fruity and sweet at first and at the end you can smell some spicy flavours, probably from his Haze parent. I really love the smell, for me it’s the #1 from WeedMD with Wine Gums. I had a look to the terpenes chart from WeedMD and it’s really out of the ordinary from the others strains. \nFor me, it’s the best strain after I went to the gym! This strain really relax my muscle, mostly after a leg day, it’s because of his high amount of CBD. It doesn’t give you a big high, but the entourage effects are amazing. I found the ratio perfect for a mid-day hit. This strain combined  with the endorphins high of the gym is a great mix! It is pretty a physical high, not much psychoactive, it doesn’t give you the couch lock, but it really relax your mind too. You can feel a little of the THC effects on the upper forehead, but you really feel the CBD effects all over you body.  \nI really love this strain, I love the fact that WeedMD have a lot of strains you can try, but if you find one you love, you have to buy a high amount of it to be sure you don’t ran out of it. For me it’s a big cons for WeedMD after a few months with them, they don‘t have a  stable inventory. I hope their green house extension will provide a regular supply of each strain. ",

At least there is some left and I can hope it will make a return.... \nThis is the best strain I have found for relieving my symptoms and allowing me to function in a better frame of mind than ever before.  The first few times I vaped it, there was a slight headache to start with, but it wore off in about 10 mins and never returned after a few days of regular use. My FM pain vanished. Full stop, gone. Arthritis pain down 90%. Anxiety, depression, stress - all vanished. But with the relief or else because of the MH, full energy like I haven't known in years. Clarity, focus, energy all made me feel like \"myself\" again. Bliss..... No \"hangover\" when it wore off or the next day. Migraines have not appeared either. \nVaping it was extremely smooth (Arizer Solo) and didn't produce any coughing or harshness. A very pretty, sweet aroma up to about 230F. Nummy. Have also made a tincture with VSOP brandy using 1g decarbed flower to 1 ounce brandy in the freezer for a week. That is some tasty stuff, with a chocolatey aftertaste. Sadly, not as effective or lasting as the vape, but it will not go to waste!\n",

Zero fruit, or especially mango anything involved here. \nBuds were small and full of stems, the trim job was very poor. \nEffects were VERY short lasting. I know this is a 1:1 thc/cbd strain, and meant to be lighter, but I've tried a few in that market and this was the lightest of the bunch, and most disappointing.\nI dunno what to say here, this buy was a total disappointment. Kiwi Cannabis doesn't even advertise this strain as one of their 4 products, and the package was very plain, which makes me think Maricann / Wayland (their parent company) just threw some random medical crap they had excess stock of in a non-descript container and pushed it out for the rec market because their *actual* Kiwi line wasn't ready yet.",

I also wanted a 1 gram package and this was all that was left. According the description on the NSLC website, this strain is supposed to have citrus and spice flavours. I sensed the spice but no citrus so it was a little disappointing. The pieces were small so the 1 gram had about 12 or 13 pieces in there, which was ok because I vaped it and each little piece was about enough to fit in the oven. So, I took a puff and felt a little tingle on the right side of my head. That was cool. While it didn't knock me out, I noticed that I was sleeping a bit deeper than usual. It also made my mind wander a bit less than usual, which was the purpose of wanting to try cannabis in the first place. In conclusion, I would not buy this again because the taste was not very nice.

I've already learned that I prefer the Indicas but I still have a difficult getting the dosing correct and the effects vary between the different strains I try. \n\nSan Rafael 71's Purple Chitral has so far given me the best effects. A very calming, relaxing and just enjoyable high. From someone that sometimes gets anxiety from different strains I found this one did not produce any of those anxious feelings and rather just a nice relaxing experience. \n\nWhile I would give the actual product 5 stars, one star is deducted due to the packaging of the product (I purchased a 1g product). Opposed to a other products I have tried, the packaging for Purple Chitral comes in a small box that is not air tight after opening once. I have included some pictures to show what I am referring to. Also, I found the weed very dry compared to some others I have tried. \n\nRegardless of those two gripes, this is certainly a product that I will purchase again and would be my product of choice to recommend to a novice user looking to try a strain for relaxing.

It helps me fall into profound restful sleep. \nI like this because it will not be a complete couch lock but just the right balance to get me in the mood to wind down after a harsh and streful day.

Be ready to be close to your bed and wear your pijama. ",

Pretty effective for unwinding after a long day, or before bed though. \nScore: 2.5/5 ",

I chose this strain because I'm more of an Indica smoke since it helps me with my insomnia and anxiety. This strain helped me with both. The moment you crack open the container, the berry and earthy flavors go right up your nose and it is REALLY GOOD! Altough I mostly got what we call \"popcorn buds\", each one is coated in crystals, well dried and cured and the purple is very present in every little bit of each bud. I took the first hit and immediatly got hit by the flowery/berry flavor with a bit earthy aftertaste. The smoke was smooth even when taking big hits. A couple minutes later, I could already feel it in my whole body, taking the stress away and hitting me with a very calm soothing body high. I watched a couple episodes of my favorite Netlfix show and I just felt very happy. Later on, I got sleepy and decided to get in my bed and slept like a baby. I really recommend this strain for anyone who really needs to kick back, relax and have a good time! ",

These aromas translate into intense flavour in both my tabletop and portable vaporizers, and is intense enough to give its smoke a nice taste.  \n\nThe batch I purchased has a perfect moisture content for vaping, and is really nice smoked in my bubbler as well. It might be a bit to moist for a good joint; I'd break it up and let it dry a bit before rolling. There aren't many trichomes on the flowers, or showing in my jar of Bud Lime, and it's not very sticky; still it packs a punch.\n\nListed as a 50/50 Hybrid, I find BCC's Bud Lime to have pronounced Sativa effects, including cerebral stimulation and slight anxiety, as noted by the previous reviewer. This anxiety puzzles me, as I don't often experience this effect from medical cannabis, especially with strains that have an average THC level, as this batch does at 11.5%.  The effect is likely caused by the strain-specific terpene profile, and I've calmed it since by combining 2/3 - 3/4 Bud Lime with 1/4 - 1/3 of an Indica-dominant strain.\n\nIndica effects are also in evidence, in the form of a mild laziness that set in about an hour after vaping. Okay, this might've been due to a lack of sleep the previous night, but it was an odd sensation when combined with the slight anxiety!\n\nI look forward to trying this strain in various forms, especially in edibles, the delivery method where I think the combination of effects will be particularly demonstrable.\n\n\nI'm very pleased with my 1st order from Broken Coast Cannabis.  Each jar I open contains top shelf product of a quality I expect to find here in the very competitive Cannabis Dispensary marketplace in Vancouver BC, but certainly didn't find with my first LP (Aphria).  Registration and ordering is simple, I had delivery within 48 hrs, the company has creative packaging and an information website. Finally, the cost of the Bud Lime strain, at $6.25/gm, is excellent.

After you exhale there is a slight juniper flavour in the mix. Kinda makes it taste like you just drank some gin and tonic with a lime wedge squeezed in. I quite like it.\n\nThis batch was 11.5% THC so with the tolerance I have I thought that was relatively low. Don't be fooled like I was.\n\nI loaded a fairly large bowl to compensate for the lower THC content. I was vaporizing steady for about 5 minutes only noticing moderate pain relief at first. There was a warming tingling sensation moving through my points of pain which could also be felt  in my feet and joints. At first I thought the cerebral effects were quite mild, I barely noticed any. Thinking it was a bit of a let down over the lack of balanced effects I put down my vape and went to my computer to get more work down. As soon as I sat down I felt a wave of cerebral high which caught me off guard. It was very sudden and unexpected so there was a slight rush of feeling anxious. The anxiousnesses faded quick as I realized this was an experience that should be enjoyed, not feared. The high was mellow, relaxing, and on the lazier side. I had no problem with wanting to work, I just wasn't very good at work. I think in small amounts this could be ideal for desk work in the afternoon. In larger amounts it's way too dreamy and distracting which is what I experienced. I had a difficult time typing emails without spelling mistakes and I spent far too long proof reading them.\n\nI would suggest this strain for late afternoon or early evening, preferably without the intention of doing mental or physical work. It's nice to use before going for a walk.\n\nSo yes, the effects are balanced. At first I only noticed  moderate pain reduction but the cerebral high does come. While it's only a moderate high it's a satisfying balanced feeling that won't couch lock you unless you let it.",

Bud lime has a amazing citrus lime smell and test. Great strain for day time. I found it was good for pain distraction and  mood elevation. \n\nI was hesitant about the lower THC of 11.5%. I found in the past that lower THC strains don't have that hanging around factor that I'm looking for. What I mean by that is I feel like I need to re-medicate more often with more cannabis. But with Bud Lime I didn't get that at all. One or two bags from my extreme Q would provide the relief I was looking for for 2-3 hours.\n\nBecause of the lower THC I decided to experiment with some coconut oil canna caps.  Basically I infused 3g's of bud lime with 2 tablespoons of oil. Making 30 capsules. So each pill should have roughly 10 milligrams of THC. \n\nI've only just tested them out. I found two pills worked perfect to help with pain, but didn't leave me feeling lethargic or tried like I'm use to with other edibles I've made. I'm sure if I where to  double the dose I might get coach locked, but what I like about the Capsule form  is  I know exactly how many to take to get the result I'm looking for. \n\nGreat job Broken Coast. For me this just shows that THC isn't everything when your considering Strains. And at less then $6g,  I will definitely be buying this again.",

Much has changed since the milled single source cannabis I ordered once a few years back. Broken Coast is the first place I have ordered from since. The products I have ordered have been good quality.  I like the container the product comes in. A drop or two of water on the inside of the lid will rehydrate over dried bud. It’s a nice touch. I also like that the compassionate pricing matches my HST(HST should not be on prescrptions). My only complaint is that prices for  medical cannabis could and should be better across the industry. If I go though the hastle of changing suplier it would be for price not service or product. I did not care for this product. The apearance was good but flavor and smell were not there for me.

My anxiety was also playing a role in slowing down my decision making and I was starting to get frustrated. Vicious cycle. I reached for some Rio Bravo aka 'Wabanaki' by Edison Cannabis Co. and rolled myself a 0.6 gram joint. By the time I had smoked half, I was already working in Excel, Photoshop and Shopify. I had music playing and the feet were tapping. Super high energy. Focused and laser sharp. Majority of the sensation is cerebral with a slight floatyness in the arms. Calm. No anxiety. Felt chatty but was home alone so put that energy into my work. I did find myself singing along and making sounds with my mouth to the music. lol. Very pleasant high. The transition back to 'normal' was without burnout. No headache. No pasties. No munchies. Great morning smoke. I would definitely purchase this product again. THC was listed at 13.7% CBD 0.0%",

Unfortunately, we do not have this one in Quebec. \nIt was my day off and I was feeling a bit down. I remembered I had this popular strain that could get me an energy and mood boost. Cove claims Rise is their version of Green Crack (that is the description on the bccannabisstores website). The THC level on the label is 14.6%\nWhen I first opened the vessel, it was not very aromatic, the buds were little and it looked somewhat dry. Without time to hydrate them a bit, I lighted up my desktop vaporizer at 370F seeking a noon buzz. After 5 minutes I decided to go for all teh THC at 392F. \nAfter the first 20 minutes I felt sonme sort of buzz, close to feeling tingling in my face and head. Then I noticed how my perception of time was altered. I felt that time was really slow. Then I started feeling more energized. \nWithin the hour I was programming a personal project and ideas started flowing, then I discoverd that I was able to read through some heavy technical details I kept postponing. I felt motivated and able to focus. \nI reached the peak at the two hours mark, I felt happy, and in general uplifted. Since I discovered I was already dancing while listening to some electrobeats I decided to walk the dog. I was able to walk it without feeling fatigued in spite of the last weeks heavy pounding at my job. It was here that I noticed that my sense of smell was quite enhanced. Not necessarily good when taking the dog for a crap. The, when I got back got some munchies that were settled with a plate of fruit I prepared beforehand. I did not feel the sense of taste affected at all, Just the smell of things was very rich, but at the same time distorted. I must say at this stage I was a bit forgetful. \nI felt too energized so I went for another walk after cleaning a bit the house. I came across some friend and I was able to keep a jiggly conversation without being affected by any social anxiety. \nThree hours in I was still able to work and focus in a bunch of things. Still motivated, creative and happy.\nI felt later that night very happy and uplifted of the experience. I knew it was not the high anymore, just how it allowed me to have a great day. \nThis product is spectacular. Probably the best I have tried so far. I will certainly buy again. I fully recommend it for those looking some energy with both mental and body effects. Recomend it for cleaning the house or even hiking. For studying, probably is best after the effects have mellowed down. Awesome!",

I have had the original indica version so I felt the difference. The Sativa in it is uplifting and pick me up, but the indica side is good for relaxing, and to “bring it down”. This is used to treat more of the depression, fatigue, and stress side of conditions. The smell and taste was a very unique profile in the terpenes. Sweet, citrus, and berries are the tones and tastes in this medicine. This is great to have mid day, evening. Great work Weed MD!",

The nugs were medium sized but were very dried out. They weren't anything out of the ordinary, as they were the standard green with orange pistels.\n\nI smoked the cannabis out of a glass bong and used a butane lighter to ignite it. The taste was as it smelled, but was noticeably more sweet. It tasted of berries and pine.\n\nThe high was very mellow and relaxing. I found myself wanting to draw and listen to music more. The downside was that I was very sleepy.\n\nAfter the high I was very tired and slept for a few hours afterward.\n\nOverall I would give this strain a 4/5 for taste, effects and appearance. But I was not expecting to be as tired as I was.",

It worked perfectly for the ailments I bought it for and the buds were all medium to large, perfectly cured and this strain smells amazing, its unique, my best description is it smells like a grape/berry wine cooler.

Aside from the bueaty hairs, the BUD itself was covered in sparkle and busted up in a hand-spun metal grinder nice a light.  Smoke this strain in joint form is my suggestion.  I found that although I got nicely stoned using a bong, this straings high was better realized a few days later by smoking by way of JOINT :)  It rolls nice and snokes slow and seemingly stronger than the bong hit.  Before smoking this strain I felt exhausted mentally... after this smoke I felt like my attitude had changed and my evening was pretty solid.  Smoking the Shishkaberry made me realize...

By itself it was relaxing and did okay for insomnia and anxiety, but it was better when blended with some Cannatonic.

I'm not sure if it's a result of being stored in these plastic containers for months waiting for legalization but it wasn't a good first impression. The bud itself looked alright, a bit light/faded in color but not unlike most other bud I've had. A nice blend of green, orange and crystals. The bud itself was very dry, practically falls apart in your hand...which is a bad sign for someone who primarily vapes.\nSo after it basically turning to dust in my grinder I loaded up my vape. I was expecting a strong taste due to that chemical smell but OOF, I couldn't even finish the bowl. It's absolutely disgusting tasting. Take the chemical smell and enhance it by 50....just gross. I haven't smoked it, it might be better smoked but the lack of moisture and the strong chemical taste/smell made it one of the most unenjoyable bud I've ever had. I honestly can't even remember the high, because I was so turned off by the taste.\nI won't be getting this strain again. Maybe once the supply catches up and I can try fresh bud but it'd take a lot for me to go back to this rather than trying another strain.\n\n2/5 stars",

The flowers are light green and covered in orange hairs- snapping into the dried buds reveals a deposit of trichomes glistening under the orange surface.\n\nEffects from tangerine dream aren't a typical sativa from what I've experienced. This strain provides myself a more relaxed & sedative feeling that is better suited for later in the day or even evenings. It can still be used for daytime, yet I have super silver haze and chocolope so those tend to be my \"go-to daytime function like a normal person\" strains currently. \n\nDecent cannabis overall, but doesn't really have a clear place or function in my medicine bag. Not quite a sleep aid, not quite daytime- yet still good. I would order it again though if my other more classic sativa type effect strains weren't in stock.",

                        "text" => "Tangerine Dream is a fresh, fruity smelling strain, that isn't too sour like an orange, but more sweet like a ripe tangerine. \nThe buds of this unique strain are coated with tangerine colored pistils of which there are copious amounts on every bud.\n \nThe flower is covered in resinous trichomes and is relatively dense throughout. The optimally cured nugs are highly impressive visually, by smell and taste. The smell almost resembles chocolope in a very subtle \"fruity\" way. G13, Afghani, and Neville's A5 Haze, all attribute the best qualities of each strain into this one of a kind, euphoric, uplifting hybrid. This is a strain that allows functionality while still providing the indica relaxation and pain relief, which is decently rare among hybrids. The effects are similar to Blue Dream and White Widow, and of course G13.\n\nAt 22.6% THC and 0.05% CBD this is a very potent batch, which rivals Kosher Kush in terms of potency. CBG @ 0.87 % adds to the effects of this strain making it mellow and sedating. Generally, this is an optimal day-time use strain that will allow the user to function with mentally-burdening tasks with ease. The euphoric rush provided by this strain also lifts one's mood and allows one to focus on the task at hand without anxiety or stress getting in the way. The cerebral effects leave you without worry, and provide a dream-state of mind without the tiring side effects that would usually accompany such a state. \n\nThe terpenes mix into a fresh aroma that is very pleasant and enjoyable, like a cool, misty breeze in a tangerine orchard. \nD-Limonene @ 0.35 % brings a fruity citrus presence in to the mix, but surprisingly of the sweet rather than a sour smell, like the smell of orange juice.\n\nNerolidol @ 0.32 % brings probably the most evident fragrance, that I could only describe as a fresh breeze of glacier wind.\nIt's a subtle yet all encompassing odor which ties everything together. The undertones of this terpene resemble cucumbers, and there is also a slight resemblance to woody/citrus/floral flavors that creep in after a while with this terpene. \n\nCaryophyllene @ 0.31 % brings an earthy, woody, and floral scent with a tiny bit of spiciness that is almost too subtle to notice. \n\nLinalool @ 0.20 % mixes very well with D-Limonene with it's sweet citrus and lavender/floral tang, which blends perfectly with the rest of the terpene fragrances. \n\nThe overall smell slightly resembles MK-Ultra, CBD strains, White Widow, and citrus sativa odors. It is very fresh smelling, and tastes more on the sour side once smoked, but rather sweet when vaped. G13 Genetics definitely pierce through the aroma once vaped.\n \nThe very prominent sweet orange smell translates into taste when inhaled, the vapor and smoke are exceptionally smooth, next to nothing in terms of harshness, even though this strain is around 23%. Perfectly dried and burns completely clean. The flavor of the smoke resembles Blueberry Lambsbread in some ways as well. 10/10 flavor. \n\nThis strain is equally effective as a day and night-time medicine. It is very helpful as an insomnia-aid, and an effective painkiller, alleviating a variety of muscle pains, and other types of discomfort. It can be a beneficial creativity booster along with the rest of it's effects, lending to the ability to complete daily tasks without getting in the way of cognitive clarity, you can definitely get things done as this sativa dominant hybrid will not impair one to the degree that an indica would. \n\nI would recommend this for anyone looking for a hybrid that encompasses all the benefits of a sativa without the drawbacks of an indica in the day-time, while still maintaining the capability to function as an indica . This strain has a CBD-like buzz that is very calming and mellow. I think this would be a good strain to try for anyone, new or seasoned to cannabis, because it's not too overpowering, but still very potent, but all the same surprising.\n\nI would definitely buy this again, it's a very clear headed high strain, and has many diverse uses. With higher amounts it becomes more similar to an indica, but at lower amounts a sativa. Would recommend for beginners, as well as anyone who is interested in a strain that can be used at any time, for virtually any need. The aroma and taste make this one of my favorite hybrids.\n\nWMMC did a phenomenal job with this product, and I am profoundly impressed once again by this remarkable, organic cannabis. \nTo compare with other LP's products, WMMC's organic product is like the inside of a tangerine , whereas conventional cannabis is like the orange peel. With every purchase I feel more content with my decision to register with WMMC.",

Lots of orange pistels and a distinct citrus smell.\n\nGrinder took care of these little nugs. Smoked a half gram joint and felt the effects licknin after about a half a dozen draws.\n\nThis strain provided the best of both worlds: a clear head high with relaxing body effects.\n\nI was able to go about my day as usual, but with all aches and pains removed and with an elevated mood.\n\nGreat strain for seasoned marijuana users and those just starting off.",

If you think the price is high, as I did, well maybe it is. But well worth it. I'm not one to pay anywhere near 10 per gram but for this stuff I dont even blink an eye. Its not super burn out weed either. Being a hybrid its not incredibly tiring so one may still reasonably expect to accomplish any planned activities for their day. One can expect more creative and uplifting  moods. But that could aslo just be me. This is, after all, just one man's humble opinion. Its pretty damn close to 10 out of 10, full package, whatever superlative one may chose to use. I'm sure building the hype. But you should find it lives up to said hype. So in closing, it would be pretty hard to be disappointed after consuming Tangerine Dream",

We picked Tangerine Dream as one of our favorites from Fred's first shipment from Whistler Medical Marijuana Corporation (WMMC). This company produces consistently powerful and effective medicine. \n\nThe odor is rich and sweet upon opening the bottle. I close my eyes and get lost in this aroma. It is as smooth as butter with a hint of oranges. And vanilla. Mmmm. \n\nThe small dense buds are medium to dark green with a moderate amount of brown pistils. There is one decent sized bud which surprises me at .9 gram. This is dense product and difficult to break by hand. I switch to the grinder. A hint of haze is detected. These buds are perfectly trimmed, definitely a labor of love when some are so tiny and cute!\n\nThe joint produces a very smooth smoke with an amazing taste of oranges. The ash is medium grey. Richness and flavor pervade the smoke.  It is pleasant indeed.\n\nHalf a joint and the effects ease on, starting in the head with a powerful presence. Eyelids lower, relaxation flows and time slows. A balance between physical and mental being is apparent. Pain fades into the background. I am aware but removed from life's immediacy and concerns. Pleasant feelings of contentment insinuate themselves into my mind. All is well. \n\nTasks seem possible but must wait until I am ready. Thoughts leave my head, never to return. This cannabis has strong effects. \n\nAppetite arrives on a bandwagon with bells and whistles. Motivation returns! I go to make a snack. It feels like a nap might be nice a little later. \n\nThe effects moderate after a while yet remain strong and long lasting. Additional doses result in increased effects. One joint lasts all day. Well, until supper time anyway. \n\nOverall, this is potent cannabis with calming and uplifting effects. It is possible to apply logic and perform tasks, but only when necessary. Chilling is preferred. Good for daytime use, or at any time. \n\nPro: Smooth smoke with a wonderful pleasing effect. This is a desirable strain. \nCon: Small buds, cost at $11 a gram. I'm searching....\n\nSunny ways and sunny days with Tangerine Dream!",

For over a decade, I've lived with a host of disabling disorders that cause full-body chronic pain and insomnia (among other things), and I was desperate for something that wasn't yet another liver-damaging pill to help. Temple not only took the edge off the pain so I could function and do things like cook and clean, but made an immediate, noticeable difference in the quality of my sleep: I went from sleeping 14-18 hours and still waking tired — sometimes going almost immediately back to bed! — to sleeping 8-10 hours and not needing another hour to wake up completely. The flavour was earthy and not too harsh, even when vaped at 220°C/428°F (I use a Pulsar APX).

It was a great way to relax late afternoon. The high didn't last too long but I also didn't use much. I didn't have any side or after effects which I sometimes have with other moderate to high THC strains.  I'm no expert, but the herb itself seems dense and a bit sticky. Definitely not overly dry. It was trimmed well and I am very happy with the product. This will be one of my go-to products for helping with anxiety, ADHD and just relaxing after work. This batch was 22.29% THC & 0.06% CBD.

I don't usually comment on visuals but this stuff really is attractive to the eye.\n\nWeedMD is well known for spectacular terpene profiles that deliver exceptional bouquets.  The smell of Ultra Sour is unlike anything I've ever smelled before.  The senses are immediately greeted by the familiar scent or citrus, imagine lemon pot pourri.  But this is accompanied by an odd chemical/gassy smell.  It is neither offputting nor attractive, it's honestly hard to say how I feel about it.\n\nSour Ultra provides a strong and pleasant citrus flavour in my Solo 2 and vapes smooth. \n\nThis stuff is very strong at 25% and should be treated delicately.  Beginners should either avoid or microdose.\n\nThe high is very cerebral and yet clean. I found myself high but not dumb or foggyminded like some other strains.\n\nIt also provides a good degree of body high, making my body feel very relaxed.\n\nIts a great all around high as long as taken in the appropriate dose.  Given the high THC content and the quality, $10 is definitely a good deal.\n\nI would consider buying this again, as a little goes a long way so it is very economical, and the quality is definitely above average.",

Coming from an seasoned smoker of countless strains over the past two decades I can without a doubt say that WeedMD has a serious contender on their hands with this one.  Also customer service has been some of the best of any producer I've dealt with.

I would love this strain at a better price, only thing holding me back from getting lots of it at a time, I don’t think paying almost 10$/g  all the way up is fair at all. After 20gs I don’t see how paying 240-270$ a ounce is beneficial to any medical patient at all. It’s extremly upsetting to see AAA strains being thrown around and easily accessible from local dispensaries and street dealers for only 100-170$ a ounce and our licensed producers are just sucking every dollar out of the medical users to get the most profit, While recreational users are basically getting  it given to them for just over a small amount of the production cost. However, this specific strain grown by WeedMD is extremely unique and gives off flavours and tastes that aren’t known to most cannabis users. The trichomes are unbelievable and makes the buds appear to be stronger than it actually is, so pretty it was ALMOST a shame to smoke and I do say almost. I will continue to buy this strain in low Increments as a way to treat myself. overall rating 7.5/10",

It provides a warm indica high but with a surprising clarity of thought and is long lasting.
