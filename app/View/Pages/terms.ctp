You acknowledge and agree that Canbii will have no obligation to provide you with any support or maintenance in connection with the Site or Services.</p><p>12.2 Changes to Terms of Use.

This Agreement, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be<br> assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without Canbii’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.<br> The terms of this Agreement shall be binding upon assignees.</p><p>12.5 Copyright/Trademark Information.
