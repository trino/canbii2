            Cannabis has been used as a form of treatment for thousands of years. The active chemical compounds, referred to as cannabinoids is the main source of its medical properties. There are 85 known cannabinoids in the plant, and probably many more. (The number keeps growing every year as new research discovers more of them.).
            This all natural plant contains tetrahydrocannabinol cannabinoids (THC) and cannabidiol cannabinoids (CBD) which helps treat illnesses or alleviate symptoms.
            What is THC and CBD? Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the main psychoactive ingredient in the plant.
            Cannabidiol (CBD) is the main ingredient that represses neurotransmitter release in the brain. Together THC and CBD offers natural and effective treatments from countless medical conditions.
        </p>

        <p align="">
            There are over 1000 strains, both natural and man-made. More strains are being created to target specific
            symptoms with strain containing different medical properties. With the sheer number of strains, how do you find that best match
            for the symptom? That's why we're here. We want to help make the search for
            you as easy possible - matching you with the most accurate medication.
